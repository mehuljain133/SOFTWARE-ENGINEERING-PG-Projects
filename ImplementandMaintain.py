# Unit-VI Implementation and Maintenance: Overview and Code Representation

# 1. Programming Standards and Procedures
# - Programming standards and procedures are essential for ensuring consistency and quality in the development process.
# We'll simulate programming standards by adhering to naming conventions, modularity, and documentation in code.

class ProgrammingStandards:
    def __init__(self, language, conventions):
        self.language = language
        self.conventions = conventions
    
    def apply_standards(self):
        print(f"\nApplying programming standards for {self.language}:")
        for convention in self.conventions:
            print(f"- {convention}")
    
# Simulate Programming Standards and Procedures
standards = ProgrammingStandards("Python", ["Use snake_case for variable names", "Use 4 spaces for indentation", "Document functions with docstrings"])
standards.apply_standards()

# 2. Modularity
# - Modularity involves dividing a system into smaller, manageable parts called modules, which can be developed and tested independently.
# We'll simulate a modular approach by dividing the system into separate classes and functions.

class ModuleA:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
    
    def process_data(self):
        return f"Processed data: {self.data}"

class ModuleB:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
    
    def analyze_data(self):
        return f"Analyzed data: {self.data}"

# Simulate Modularity
module_a = ModuleA("Data from Module A")
module_b = ModuleB("Data from Module B")
print("\nModular System Output:")
print(module_a.process_data())
print(module_b.analyze_data())

# 3. Data Abstraction
# - Data abstraction hides the implementation details and exposes only the necessary information.
# We'll use a class that abstracts the details of a bank account.

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):
        self._account_number = account_number
        self._balance = balance
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self._balance += amount
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self._balance >= amount:
            self._balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds")
    
    def get_balance(self):
        return self._balance

# Simulate Data Abstraction with BankAccount
account = BankAccount("12345", 1000)
account.deposit(500)
account.withdraw(200)
print(f"\nAccount Balance: {account.get_balance()}")

# 4. Static Analysis
# - Static analysis is the process of analyzing code without executing it. Tools like linters are used for static analysis.
# We'll simulate a simple static analysis for checking if a variable is unused.

class StaticAnalysis:
    def __init__(self, code_lines):
        self.code_lines = code_lines
    
    def check_unused_variables(self):
        print("\nStatic Analysis Results:")
        for line in self.code_lines:
            if "unused_variable" in line:
                print(f"Warning: Unused variable detected in line: {line}")
    
# Simulate Static Analysis
code_lines = [
    "x = 10",
    "unused_variable = 20",
    "print(x)"
]
static_analysis = StaticAnalysis(code_lines)
static_analysis.check_unused_variables()

# 5. Unit Testing
# - Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code to ensure they work as expected.
# We'll use a simple test to check the correctness of a function.

import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestAddFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)

# Simulate Unit Testing
unittest.TextTestRunner().run(unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(TestAddFunction))

# 6. Integration Testing
# - Integration testing checks the interaction between different modules or components to ensure they work together correctly.
# We simulate integration testing by combining `ModuleA` and `ModuleB` and ensuring their combined functionality works.

class IntegrationTest:
    def test_integration(self):
        module_a = ModuleA("Data A")
        module_b = ModuleB("Data B")
        result_a = module_a.process_data()
        result_b = module_b.analyze_data()
        assert "Processed" in result_a and "Analyzed" in result_b, "Integration Test Failed"
        print("\nIntegration Test Passed")

# Simulate Integration Testing
integration_test = IntegrationTest()
integration_test.test_integration()

# 7. Regression Testing
# - Regression testing ensures that recent changes do not negatively affect the existing functionality.
# We will simulate a test suite that ensures previously tested functionality remains intact.

class RegressionTest:
    def test_regression(self):
        assert add(2, 3) == 5, "Regression Test Failed"
        assert add(-1, 1) == 0, "Regression Test Failed"
        print("\nRegression Test Passed")

# Simulate Regression Testing
regression_test = RegressionTest()
regression_test.test_regression()

# 8. Verification and Validation
# - Verification ensures the product is built correctly, while validation ensures the correct product is built.
# We simulate these processes through simple checks.

class VerificationValidation:
    def __init__(self, product, requirements):
        self.product = product
        self.requirements = requirements
    
    def verify(self):
        print("\nVerification: Checking if product is built correctly...")
        if "ModuleA" in self.product and "ModuleB" in self.product:
            print("Verification passed: All required modules are present.")
        else:
            print("Verification failed: Missing required modules.")
    
    def validate(self):
        print("\nValidation: Checking if product meets the requirements...")
        if "User Authentication" in self.requirements:
            print("Validation passed: Meets user authentication requirement.")
        else:
            print("Validation failed: Missing user authentication requirement.")

# Simulate Verification and Validation
verification_validation = VerificationValidation(
    product=["ModuleA", "ModuleB"],
    requirements=["User Authentication", "Shopping Cart"]
)
verification_validation.verify()
verification_validation.validate()

# 9. Tools for Testing
# - Various tools are available for testing, such as pytest for unit testing, Selenium for UI testing, etc.
# We'll simulate using a simple testing tool (mock tool).

class TestingTool:
    def __init__(self, tool_name):
        self.tool_name = tool_name
    
    def use_tool(self):
        print(f"\nUsing testing tool: {self.tool_name}")
        if self.tool_name == "pytest":
            print("Running unit tests with pytest...")
        elif self.tool_name == "Selenium":
            print("Running UI tests with Selenium...")

# Simulate Tools for Testing
testing_tool = TestingTool("pytest")
testing_tool.use_tool()

# 10. Fault Tolerance
# - Fault tolerance involves designing a system that continues to function even if some parts fail.
# We simulate a simple example where a function handles a division-by-zero error gracefully.

class FaultTolerance:
    def safe_divide(self, a, b):
        try:
            return a / b
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
            return None

# Simulate Fault Tolerance
fault_tolerance = FaultTolerance()
print(f"\nSafe Division Result: {fault_tolerance.safe_divide(10, 0)}")

# 11. The Maintenance Problem
# - Maintenance involves modifying and updating the software after its release to fix defects, improve performance, or adapt to new requirements.
# We'll simulate a situation where maintenance is required to fix a bug.

class MaintenanceProblem:
    def __init__(self, bug_report):
        self.bug_report = bug_report
    
    def fix_bug(self):
        print(f"\nFixing Bug: {self.bug_report}")
        print("Bug fixed. System is updated.")

# Simulate Maintenance Problem
maintenance = MaintenanceProblem("User unable to log in after password reset")
maintenance.fix_bug()

# 12. The Nature of Maintenance
# - The nature of maintenance includes activities such as bug fixing, enhancements, and system upgrades.
# Simulating the nature of maintenance by enhancing a system component.

class NatureOfMaintenance:
    def enhance_system(self):
        print("\nEnhancing System: Adding new features and improving performance...")
        print("System enhancement complete.")

# Simulate Nature of Maintenance
maintenance_nature = NatureOfMaintenance()
maintenance_nature.enhance_system()

# 13. Planning for Maintenance
# - Planning for maintenance involves preparing for future changes and updates to the system.
# We simulate planning for maintenance by scheduling regular updates.

class MaintenancePlanning:
    def schedule_maintenance(self):
        print("\nScheduling Maintenance: Regular system updates and bug fixes.")
        print("Maintenance scheduled for next month.")

# Simulate Planning for Maintenance
maintenance_planning = MaintenancePlanning()
maintenance_planning.schedule_maintenance()
